## go-service-gdrive

[Google Drive] is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google.
This project will use [Google Drive]'s native SDK e.g: [google.golang.org/api/drive/v3](https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/drive/v3)
to implement [go-storage]'s Storager interface,
enabling users to manipulate data in [Google Drive] through a unified interface.
